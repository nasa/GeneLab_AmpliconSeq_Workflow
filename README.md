# GeneLab Amplicon Illumina Sequencing Data Processing Workflow

> GeneLab, part of NASA's [Open Science Data Repository (OSDR)](https://www.nasa.gov/osdr/), has wrapped each step of the Illumina amplicon sequencing data processing pipeline ([AmpIllumina](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/master/Amplicon)), starting with pipeline version C, into a Nextflow workflow. This repository contains information about the workflow along with instructions for installation and usage. Exact workflow run info and AmpIllumina version used to process specific datasets hosted on the [OSDR data repository](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/) are provided alongside their processed data in OSDR under 'Files' -> 'GeneLab Processed Diversity Amplicon Files' -> 'Processing Info'.

## General Workflow Info

### Implementation Tools

The current GeneLab Illumina amplicon sequencing data processing pipeline (AmpIllumina), [GL-DPPD-7104-C.md](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Amplicon/Illumina/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7104_Versions/GL-DPPD-7104-C.md), is implemented as a [Nextflow](https://nextflow.io/) DSL2 workflow and utilizes [Singularity](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.10/user-guide/introduction.html) containers, [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) containers, or [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environments to install/run all tools. This workflow is run using the command line interface (CLI) of any unix-based system.  While knowledge of creating workflows in Nextflow is not required to run the workflow as is, [the Nextflow documentation](https://nextflow.io/docs/latest/index.html) is a useful resource for users who want to modify and/or extend this workflow.   

### Resource Requirements <!-- omit in toc -->

The table below details the default maximum resource allocations for individual Nextflow processes.

| CPU Cores | Memory |
|-------------------|----------------|
| 2                 | 5 GB           |

> **Note:** These per-process resource allocations are defaults. They can be adjusted by modifying `cpus` and `memory` directives in the configuration file: [`nextflow.config`](workflow_code/nextflow.config).

### 1. Install Nextflow, Singularity, and Conda

#### 1a. Install Nextflow and Conda

Nextflow can be installed either through the [Anaconda bioconda channel](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/nextflow) or as documented on the [Nextflow documentation page](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html).

> Note: If you wish to install conda, we recommend installing a Miniforge version appropriate for your system, as documented on the [conda-forge website](https://conda-forge.org/download/), where you can find basic binaries for most systems. More detailed miniforge documentation is available in the [miniforge github repository](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge).
> 
> Once conda is installed on your system, you can install the latest version of Nextflow by running the following commands:
> 
> ```bash
> conda install -c bioconda nextflow
> nextflow self-update
> ```
> You may also install [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) first which is a faster implementation of conda and can be used as a drop-in replacement:
> ```bash
> conda install -c conda-forge mamba
> ```

<br>

#### 1b. Install Singularity

Singularity is a container platform that allows usage of containerized software. This enables the GeneLab workflow to retrieve and use all software required for processing without the need to install the software directly on the user's system.

We recommend installing Singularity on a system wide level as per the associated [documentation](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.10/admin-guide/admin_quickstart.html).

> Note: Singularity is also available through the [Anaconda conda-forge channel](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/singularity).

> Note: Alternatively, Docker can be used in place of Singularity. To get started with Docker, see the [Docker CE installation documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

### 2. Download the Workflow Files

All files required for utilizing the NF_AmpIllumina GeneLab workflow for processing amplicon Illumina data are in the [workflow_code](workflow_code) directory. To get a copy of the latest *NF_AmpIllumina* version on to your system, the code can be downloaded as a zip file from the release page then unzipped after downloading by running the following commands: 

```bash
wget https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_AmpliconSeq_Workflow/releases/download/v1.0.0/NF_AmpIllumina_1.0.0.zip
unzip NF_AmpIllumina_1.0.0.zip && cd NF_AmpIllumina_1.0.0
```

<br>

---

### 3. Fetch Singularity Images

Although Nextflow can fetch Singularity images from a url, doing so may cause issues as detailed [here](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow/issues/1210).

To avoid this issue, run the following command to fetch the Singularity images prior to running the NF_AmpIllumina workflow:

> Note: This command should be run in the location containing the `NF_AmpIllumina_1.0.0` directory that was downloaded in [step 2](#2-download-the-workflow-files) above. Depending on your network speed, fetching the images will take ~20 minutes. Approximately 4GB of RAM is needed to download and build the Singularity images.

```bash
bash ./bin/prepull_singularity.sh nextflow.config
```

Once complete, a `singularity` folder containing the Singularity images will be created. Run the following command to export this folder as a Nextflow configuration environment variable to ensure Nextflow can locate the fetched images:

```bash
export NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR=$(pwd)/singularity
```

<br>

---

### 4. Run the Workflow

> ***Note:** All the commands in this step assume that the workflow will be run from within the `NF_AmpIllumina_1.0.0` directory that was downloaded in [step 2](#2-download-the-workflow-files) above. They may also be run from a different location by providing the full path to the main.nf workflow file in the `NF_AmpIllumina_1.0.0` directory.*

For options and detailed help on how to run the workflow, run the following command:

```bash
nextflow run main.nf --help
```

> Note: Nextflow commands use both single hyphen arguments (e.g. -help) that denote general Nextflow arguments and double hyphen arguments (e.g. --input_file) that denote workflow specific parameters.  Take care to use the proper number of hyphens for each argument.

<br>

#### 4a. Approach 1: Start with OSD or GLDS accession as input

```bash
nextflow run main.nf \
   -resume \
   -profile singularity \
   --target_region 16S \
   --accession OSD-487 
```

<br>

#### 4b. Approach 2: Start with a runsheet csv file as input

```bash
nextflow run main.nf \
   -resume \
   -profile singularity \
   --target_region 16S \
   --input_file PE_file.csv \
   --F_primer AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG \
   --R_primer CTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT 
```

<br>


**Required Parameters For All Approaches:**

* `main.nf` - Instructs Nextflow to run the NF_AmpIllumina workflow. If running in a directory other than `NF_AmpIllumina_1.0.0`, replace with the full path to the NF_AmpIllumina main.nf workflow file.

#### 4c. Modify parameters and compute resources in the Nextflow config file

Additionally, all parameters and workflow resources can be directly specified in the [nextflow.config](./workflow_code/nextflow.config) file. For detailed instructions on how to modify and set parameters in the config file, please see the [documentation here](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html).

Once you've downloaded the workflow template, you can modify the parameters in the `params` scope and cpus/memory requirements in the `process` scope in your downloaded version of the [nextflow.config](workflow_code/nextflow.config) file as needed in order to match your dataset and system setup. Additionally, if necessary, you can modify each variable in the [nextflow.config](workflow_code/nextflow.config) file to be consistent with the study you want to process and the computer you're using for processing.

### 5. Workflow Outputs

#### 5a. Main Outputs

The outputs from this pipeline are documented in the [GL-DPPD-7104-C](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Amplicon/Illumina/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7104_Versions/GL-DPPD-7104-C.md) processing protocol.

#### 5b. Resource Logs

Standard Nextflow resource usage logs are also produced as follows:

**Nextflow Resource Usage Logs**
   - Resource_Usage/execution_report_{timestamp}.html (an html report that includes metrics about the workflow execution including computational resources and exact workflow process commands)
   - Resource_Usage/execution_timeline_{timestamp}.html (an html timeline for all processes executed in the workflow)
   - Resource_Usage/execution_trace_{timestamp}.txt (an execution tracing file that contains information about each process executed in the workflow, including: submission time, start time, completion time, cpu and memory used, machine-readable output)

> Further details about these logs can also found within [this Nextflow documentation page](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html#execution-report).

<br>

---

### 6. Post-processing

> Please note that to run the post-processing workflow successfully, you MUST run the processing workflow above via the [launch.sh](workflow_code/launch.sh) script first. Please see the [script](workflow_code/launch.sh) for how to run it and make sure to edit the place holders before running it.

The post-processing workflow generates a README file, a protocols file, an md5sums table, and a file association table suitable for uploading to OSDR.

For options and detailed help on how to run the post-processing workflow, run the following command:

```bash
nextflow run post_processing.nf --help
```

To generate the post-processing files after running the main processing workflow successfully, modify and set the parameters in [post_processing.config](workflow_code/post_processing.config), then run the following command:

```bash
nextflow run post_processing.nf \
   -c post_processing.config \ 
   -resume \
   -profile singularity
``` 

The outputs of the post-processing workflow are described below:
> *Note: The outputs will be in a directory called `Post_Processing` by default*
