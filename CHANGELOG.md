## [1.0.6](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_AmpliconSeq_Workflow/tree/NF_AmpIllumina_1.0.6)

### Added

- `dpt-isa-to-runsheet` now uses local plugin directories
- Versions of "hexbin" and "vsn" are now in software_versions.txt

### Changed

- Moved reference taxonomy database download from DADA R script into a dedicated Nextflow process (DOWNLOAD_DATABASE)
- Updated filtered FastQC/MultiQC steps to use filtered reads instead of trimmed reads
- Removed `rarefaction_depth.txt` from README, processed_md5sum, and curation table
- Excluded files not intended for OSDR from processed_md5sum
- Revised curation table to match agreed-upon format with the curation team
- Updated protocol text to remove unsupported characters

## [1.0.5](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_AmpliconSeq_Workflow/tree/NF_AmpIllumina_1.0.5)

### Added

- Added retries to remote raw read staging: for `--accession` runs, raw reads are downloaded with `wget` instead of being staged in Nextflow as paths. 

<br>

---

## [1.0.4](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_AmpliconSeq_Workflow/tree/NF_AmpIllumina_1.0.4)

### Changed

- Added dynamic legend sizing in taxonomy plots to prevent long taxa names from reducing plot area
- Added retries and load validation around Figshare reference database downloads in R processing scripts

<br>

---

## [1.0.3](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_AmpliconSeq_Workflow/tree/NF_AmpIllumina_1.0.3)

### Added

- Zipping plots generated by subdirectories of Final_outputs

### Changed

- Added output_prefix to README, processed md5sum, and processing_info.zip
- Used assay_suffix param instead of hardcoded value in config files
- Fixed README typo and pass expected output filename
- Updated file associations table to include outputs of Final_outputs subdirectories
- Updated README file and processed md5sum file to replace individual plot files with their respective zipped files and reflect OSDR's Files tree structure


### Fixed

- Fixed regex pattern in ANCOMBC scripts so factor conditions with underscores are parsed correctly
- Fixed runsheet handling so params.input_file paths with spaces no longer break processes

<br>

## [1.0.2](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_AmpliconSeq_Workflow/tree/NF_AmpIllumina_1.0.2)


### Changed

- Beta diversity script now uses the same rarefaction depth logic as the alpha diversity script; removed separate rarefaction adjustment.
- Added "GLAmpSeq" suffixes to all output files
- Added 3 retry attempts for OSDR file downloads


<br>

## [1.0.1](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_AmpliconSeq_Workflow/tree/NF_AmpIllumina_1.0.1)

### Added

- Rarefaction depth checks to alpha diversity with warning/error based on depth levels
- File output for rarefaction depth values for post-processing protocol use
- Raw reads are now staged in main.nf and renamed with COPY_READS using sample names and raw read suffix parameters

### Changed

- Updated FastQC container source to biocontainers
- Synchronized license table format with RNAseq license table
- Fixed relative paths of output directories and Nextflow-generated reports (timeline, report, trace)
- Fixed relative paths of input/output directories for post-processing workflow
- Removed "samples" parameter ("unique-sample-IDs.txt") from post-processing workflow, now uses "GLfile.csv"
- File associations table generation now uses sample names from assay table 
- An underscore ("\_") is now appended to the output prefix if params.output_prefix is not empty and does not end with "\_" or "-"
- Updated README generation script and linked it to workflow
- Updated protocol generation script with rarefaction depth checks

### Fixed

- Fixed issue where alpha diversity fails after rarefaction plot
- Fixed issue with diversity.df mangled sample name characters caused by estimate_richness()

### Removed

- Removed `GLparams_file.csv`, primer and target region info is now read from the runsheet
