### Added

- Zipping plots generated by subdirectories of Final_outputs

### Changed

- Used assay_suffix param instead of hardcoded value in config files
- Fixed README typo and pass expected output filename
- Updated file associations table to include outputs of Final_outputs subdirectories

## [1.0.2](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_AmpliconSeq_Workflow/tree/NF_AmpIllumina_1.0.2)


### Changed

- Beta diversity script now uses the same rarefaction depth logic as the alpha diversity script; removed separate rarefaction adjustment.
- Added "GLAmpSeq" suffixes to all output files
- Added 3 retry attempts for OSDR file downloads

## [1.0.1](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_AmpliconSeq_Workflow/tree/NF_AmpIllumina_1.0.1)

### Added

- Rarefaction depth checks to alpha diversity with warning/error based on depth levels
- File output for rarefaction depth values for post-processing protocol use
- Raw reads are now staged in main.nf and renamed with COPY_READS using sample names and raw read suffix parameters

### Changed

- Updated FastQC container source to biocontainers
- Synchronized license table format with RNAseq license table
- Fixed relative paths of output directories and Nextflow-generated reports (timeline, report, trace)
- Fixed relative paths of input/output directories for post-processing workflow
- Removed "samples" parameter ("unique-sample-IDs.txt") from post-processing workflow, now uses "GLfile.csv"
- File associations table generation now uses sample names from assay table 
- An underscore ("\_") is now appended to the output prefix if params.output_prefix is not empty and does not end with "\_" or "-"
- Updated README generation script and linked it to workflow
- Updated protocol generation script with rarefaction depth checks

### Fixed

- Fixed issue where alpha diversity fails after rarefaction plot
- Fixed issue with diversity.df mangled sample name characters caused by estimate_richness()

### Removed

- Removed `GLparams_file.csv`, primer and target region info is now read from the runsheet
